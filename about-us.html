            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                <span>LIYANA Healthcare Plc. (LHC):</span> is an integrated healthcare Solutions Company 
                located in Hawassa, Ethiopia, approximately 275 km south of Addis Ababa. 
                The company's journey began with the establishment of Unity Higher Clinic 
                in July 2005 in Dilla town, a successful internal medicine facility founded 
                by Dr. Girma Ababi and his colleagues. Within a year, the clinic expanded by 
                opening Selam Higher Clinic in the same town. In 2012, Dr. Girma moved to Hawassa
                city and established Yanet Internal Medicine Higher Clinic (YIMHC), which quickly 
                grew into a prominent medical service provider. By November 2013, YIMHC had launched 
                Yanet Drugs and Medical Supplies Wholesale (YD&MSWS), becoming a major distributor of 
                medical supplies in Southern Ethiopia. In December 2016, the clinic was upgraded to 
                Yanet Internal Medicine Specialized Center (YIMSC), offering an array of specialized 
                internal medicine services with advanced medical technologies and highly qualified 
                specialists.
                In July 2018, LIYANA Healthcare Plc. was officially formed, incorporating Yanet Trauma 
                and Surgery Specialty Center as its core business entity, and later adding Yanet Internal 
                Medicine Specialty Center, Yanet Drugs and Medical Supplies Wholesale, and Yanet Drugs and 
                Medical Supplies Import in July 2019. Today, LHC operates six active business lines and is 
                on the verge of launching two additional facilities. The company has also initiated major 
                projects, including Yanet Hospital in Addis Ababa and Yanet Cancer Center in Hawassa, aiming 
                to enhance its healthcare services and extend its impact across the region.
